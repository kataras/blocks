<!-- You can define more than one block.
The default one is "content" which should be the main template's body.
So, even if it's missing (see index.html), it's added automatically by the view engine.
When you need to define more than one block, you have to be more specific:
-->
{{ define "content" }}
<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
{{ end }}

{{ define "message" }}
<p style="color:red;">{{.Message}}</p>
{{ end }}
